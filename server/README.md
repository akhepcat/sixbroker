The contents of this directory should be installed somewhere in /etc
we default to /etc/wireguard, though that can be changed in the default configuration file

the file  'wgserver'   should be placed in /etc/default,  as it's used for
the base configuration of the server system and holds all the user-changable
variables necessary for the basic operation of the system.  
Note that this file shouldn't be renamed.

the 'client-cfgs/'  directory holds a configuration-file for every registered client
  * This file *may* contain the client's private key, if (optionally) generated by the server

the 'clients/'  directory holds the public key of every registered client

the 'private/'  directory holds the public and private keys of the server

'clients.conf'  contains the IPv6 configuration for any client doing IPv6 tunneling

'server.conf'  is the wireguard configuration file for the service management script.

wg-server.sh  is the actual service management script.   the '-server' portion tells the
script which conf file to load:
 *  'wg-server.sh'  loads  'server.conf'
 *  'wg-foo.sh'   loads 'foo.conf'

and so on.
